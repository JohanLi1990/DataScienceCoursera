### Use of run_analysis.r

To reuse run_analysis.r, you may have to change the file Url inside the scripts. 
```R
setwd("~/Documents/DataScienceCoursera/Getting_Cleaning_Data_Project")
```
Replace with
```R
setwd("~/Your_File_Path")

```
Besides the file path, you have to install dplyr and plyr packages in your local Rstudio in order to reproduce the same result.
